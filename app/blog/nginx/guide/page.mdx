## Introduction

Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is a powerful, high-performance web server, reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache. Originally created to solve the C10K problem (handling 10,000+ concurrent connections), Nginx has grown to become one of the most popular web servers in the world, powering approximately 30% of all websites.

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started with Nginx, from installation to advanced configuration techniques.

## Why Choose Nginx?

Before diving into the technical details, let's understand why Nginx might be the right choice for your infrastructure:

- **High Performance**: Asynchronous, event-driven architecture that can handle thousands of concurrent connections with minimal resource usage
- **Stability**: Known for its rock-solid reliability even under heavy loads
- **Flexibility**: Works as a web server, reverse proxy, load balancer, and more
- **Simple Configuration**: Clean, declarative configuration syntax
- **Active Development**: Regular updates and improvements
- **Wide Adoption**: Extensive community support and documentation

## Installation

### On Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
# Update package lists
sudo apt update

# Install Nginx
sudo apt install nginx

# Start Nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx

# Enable Nginx to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable nginx

# Check status
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

### On CentOS/RHEL

```bash
# Install EPEL repository first (if not already installed)
sudo yum install epel-release

# Install Nginx
sudo yum install nginx

# Start Nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx

# Enable Nginx to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable nginx

# Check status
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

### On macOS (using Homebrew)

```bash
# Install Homebrew if not already installed
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install Nginx
brew install nginx

# Start Nginx
brew services start nginx
```

### On Windows

For Windows, you can download the Windows binary from the [official Nginx website](http://nginx.org/en/download.html) and follow these steps:

1. Extract the zip file to a location like `C:\nginx`
2. Open Command Prompt as Administrator
3. Navigate to the Nginx directory: `cd C:\nginx`
4. Start Nginx: `start nginx`

## Basic Concepts

Before we dive into configuration, let's understand some key Nginx concepts:

### 1. Master and Worker Processes

Nginx operates with a master process and multiple worker processes:
- **Master Process**: Reads configuration, manages worker processes
- **Worker Processes**: Handle actual processing of connections

### 2. Directives and Contexts

The Nginx configuration consists of:
- **Directives**: Individual configuration instructions (e.g., `server_name example.com;`)
- **Contexts**: Sections that group related directives (e.g., `http`, `server`, `location`)

### 3. Virtual Hosts (Server Blocks)

Similar to Apache's virtual hosts, Nginx uses server blocks to define settings for specific domains or IP addresses.

## Basic Configuration

The main Nginx configuration file is typically located at:
- `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` (Linux)
- `/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` (macOS with Homebrew)
- `C:\nginx\conf\nginx.conf` (Windows)

### Understanding the Default Configuration

A basic `nginx.conf` file looks like this:

```nginx
user www-data;
worker_processes auto;
pid /run/nginx.pid;
include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;

events {
    worker_connections 768;
    # multi_accept on;
}

http {
    # Basic Settings
    sendfile on;
    tcp_nopush on;
    tcp_nodelay on;
    keepalive_timeout 65;
    types_hash_max_size 2048;

    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type application/octet-stream;

    # Logging Settings
    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;

    # Gzip Settings
    gzip on;

    # Virtual Host Configs
    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
    include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;
}
```

Let's break down the key components:

- `user`: Defines which user the worker processes will run as
- `worker_processes`: Number of worker processes to spawn (auto = one per CPU core)
- `events`: Configuration for the event-based processing model
- `worker_connections`: Maximum connections each worker can handle
- `http`: Main context for HTTP-related directives
- `include`: Imports additional configuration files

### Creating Your First Server Block

Let's create a basic server block to serve a static website:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com www.example.com;

    root /var/www/example.com;
    index index.html index.htm;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

Save this to `/etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com` and create a symbolic link to enable it:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t  # Test the configuration
sudo systemctl reload nginx  # Apply changes
```

## Setting Up Nginx as a Reverse Proxy

One of Nginx's most common use cases is as a reverse proxy for application servers like Node.js, Ruby on Rails, or Django.

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name app.example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

This configuration proxies all requests to a local application running on port 3000.

## Load Balancing with Nginx

Nginx can distribute traffic across multiple backend servers:

```nginx
upstream backend_servers {
    server backend1.example.com weight=3;
    server backend2.example.com;
    server backup1.example.com backup;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name loadbalancer.example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend_servers;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `weight=3` means backend1 gets 3x more requests than backend2
- `backup` means this server is only used when others are unavailable

## SSL/TLS Configuration

Securing your website with HTTPS is essential. Here's how to configure Nginx with SSL:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name secure.example.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;  # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name secure.example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com.key;

    # Modern SSL configuration (recommended)
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers off;

    # HSTS (optional but recommended)
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000" always;

    root /var/www/secure.example.com;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

### Setting Up with Let's Encrypt

For free SSL certificates, Let's Encrypt is a popular choice:

```bash
# Install Certbot
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx

# Obtain and install certificate
sudo certbot --nginx -d example.com -d www.example.com

# Verify auto-renewal
sudo systemctl status certbot.timer
```

## Optimizing Nginx Performance

### Cache Configuration

```nginx
http {
    # File cache settings
    open_file_cache max=1000 inactive=20s;
    open_file_cache_valid 30s;
    open_file_cache_min_uses 2;
    open_file_cache_errors on;

    # Gzip compression
    gzip on;
    gzip_comp_level 5;
    gzip_min_length 256;
    gzip_proxied any;
    gzip_vary on;
    gzip_types
        application/atom+xml
        application/javascript
        application/json
        application/ld+json
        application/manifest+json
        application/rss+xml
        application/vnd.geo+json
        application/vnd.ms-fontobject
        application/x-font-ttf
        application/x-web-app-manifest+json
        application/xhtml+xml
        application/xml
        font/opentype
        image/bmp
        image/svg+xml
        image/x-icon
        text/cache-manifest
        text/css
        text/plain
        text/vcard
        text/vnd.rim.location.xloc
        text/vtt
        text/x-component
        text/x-cross-domain-policy;
}
```

### Worker Optimization

```nginx
# Set to number of CPU cores
worker_processes auto;

# Adjust worker connections based on system limits
worker_rlimit_nofile 65535;
events {
    worker_connections 65535;
    multi_accept on;
    use epoll;
}
```

### Buffer Optimization

```nginx
http {
    client_body_buffer_size 16k;
    client_header_buffer_size 1k;
    client_max_body_size 10m;
    large_client_header_buffers 4 8k;
}
```

## Security Enhancements

### Basic Security Headers

```nginx
server {
    # Other configuration...

    # Security headers
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
    add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN;
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
    add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://www.google-analytics.com; img-src 'self' data: https://www.google-analytics.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; font-src 'self'; object-src 'none'";
    add_header Referrer-Policy strict-origin-when-cross-origin;

    # Hide Nginx version
    server_tokens off;
}
```

### Rate Limiting

```nginx
http {
    # Define a zone for rate limiting
    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=one:10m rate=1r/s;

    server {
        # Apply rate limiting to login endpoint
        location /login {
            limit_req zone=one burst=5 nodelay;
            # Rest of your configuration...
        }
    }
}
```

## Logging and Monitoring

### Custom Log Formats

```nginx
http {
    log_format detailed '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] '
                        '"$request" $status $body_bytes_sent '
                        '"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" '
                        '$request_time $upstream_response_time $pipe';

    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log detailed;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log warn;
}
```

### Log Rotation

Nginx log files can grow quickly. Most Linux distributions configure log rotation automatically, but you can check the config at `/etc/logrotate.d/nginx`.

## Advanced Features

### HTTP/2 Support

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name example.com;

    # SSL configuration...
}
```

### WebSocket Support

```nginx
server {
    # Other configuration...

    location /websocket/ {
        proxy_pass http://websocket_backend;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }
}
```

### Dynamic Modules

Nginx supports extending functionality through modules. For example, to add GeoIP functionality:

```bash
sudo apt install nginx-module-geoip
```

Then in your configuration:

```nginx
load_module modules/ngx_http_geoip_module.so;

http {
    geoip_country /usr/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat;

    # Use GeoIP data in configuration
    server {
        location / {
            if ($geoip_country_code = "US") {
                return 302 https://us.example.com$request_uri;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Testing Configuration

Always test configuration changes before applying them:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

### Checking Logs

Logs are your best friend when troubleshooting:

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
```

### Debugging Configuration

For deeper debugging, increase the logging level:

```nginx
error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log debug;
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Permission Problems**
```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/example.com
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/example.com
   ```

2. **Port Binding Issues**
```bash
# Check if something else is using port 80
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :80
   ```

3. **SSL Certificate Problems**
```bash
# Verify certificate and key
sudo openssl x509 -in /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com.crt -text -noout
sudo openssl rsa -in /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com.key -check
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep configurations in separate files** rather than one monolithic file
2. **Use includes** to maintain organization
3. **Version control your configurations** to track changes
4. **Start with minimal configurations** and add only what you need
5. **Use meaningful names** for server blocks and upstream groups
6. **Comment your configuration** for future reference
7. **Regularly update Nginx** to benefit from security patches and new features
8. **Monitor performance** and adjust configurations as needed
9. **Back up configurations** before major changes
10. **Use staging environments** to test configurations before deploying to production
